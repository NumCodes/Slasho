# 🎮 SLASHO

**Slasho** is a fast-paced slicing game inspired by Fruit Ninja — but with a twist! Instead of fruit, players slash through colorful, 3D-rendered cubes flying across the screen. Built with pure **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this 8kB masterpiece delivers stunning visuals, real-time physics, and dynamic gameplay with zero dependencies.
